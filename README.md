Submitted by: Rahat Moktadir

This web app:
**Brain Boost** is an interactive study tool designed to help users expand their knowledge across various subjects, including Computer Science, Environmental Science, Math, and History. Featuring a sleek and user-friendly interface, the app allows users to test their memory with visually engaging flashcards that include images, category-based colors, and a dynamic question-and-answer format.

Users can enter their guesses, receive instant feedback, and navigate through cards using next and previous buttons. Additional features include shuffle mode for randomized learning, streak tracking for progress monitoring, and the ability to mark mastered cards. With smooth animations and an intuitive design, **Brain Boost** makes studying fun and effective!

## Notes

Some challenges encountered while building the app included **managing state for card flipping and navigation**, **ensuring images loaded correctly from the assets folder**, and **styling the UI to keep everything centered and visually appealing**. Additionally, implementing **category-based colors** and **hover effects** required careful CSS adjustments for a smooth user experience.
